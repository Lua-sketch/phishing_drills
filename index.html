            <p>The email you received was not actually from Voice of Frisco, but from
                the SecureBytes team (if you're wondering how we got your email address, we recently
                sent out a Google Form to collect data for the research phase of our project).
            </p>
            <p>The email was constructed to look like a phishing email (a malicious email
                sent by cybercriminals to get you to click on a malicious link or attachment). If this email
                had been a real attack, you could have fallen for it. Here is how you can protect yourself
                from real phishing attempts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Urgent call to action or threats</strong> - Be suspicious of emails that claim you must click,
                    call, or open an attachment immediately. Often, they'll claim you have to act now to
                    claim a reward or avoid a penalty. Creating a false sense of urgency is a common trick
                    of phishing attacks and scams. They do that so that you won't think about it too much or
                    consult with a trusted advisor who may warn you.</li>
                <li><strong>First time or infrequent senders</strong> - While it's not unusual to receive an email from
                    someone for the first time, especially if they are outside your organization, this can be a sign of
                    phishing. When you get an email from somebody you don't recognize, take a moment to examine it extra
                    carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Spelling and bad grammar</strong> - Professional companies and organizations
                    usually have an editorial staff to make sure customers get high-quality, professional
                    content. If an email message has obvious spelling or grammatical errors, it might be a
                    scam. These errors are sometimes the result of awkward translation from a foreign
                    language, and sometimes they're deliberate in an attempt to evade filters that try to
                    block these attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Generic greetings</strong> - An organization that works with you should know your
                    name and these days it's easy to personalize an email. If the email starts with a generic
                    "Dear sir or madam" that's a warning sign that it might not really be your bank or shopping
                     site.</li>
                <li><strong>Mismatched email domains or message sent from public domain</strong> - If the email claims to be from a reputable
                    company, like Microsoft or your bank, but the email is being sent from another email
                    domain like Gmail.com, or microsoftsupport.ru it's probably a scam. Also be watchful for
                    very subtle misspellings of the legitimate domain name.<br>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>micros0ft.com where the second "o" has been replaced by a 0</li>
                        <li>rnicrosoft.com, where the "m" has been replaced by an "r" and a "n"</li>
                        <li>no-reply@netfllx.com where the "i" in netflix has been replaced by an "l"</li>
                    </ul>
                    These are common tricks of scammers.</li>
                <li><strong>Suspicious links or unexpected attachments</strong> - If you suspect that an email
                    message is a scam, don't open any links or attachments that you see. Instead, hover your
                    mouse over, but don't click, the link to see if the address matches the link that was
                    typed in the message. Unfortunately, many legitimate and scam emails hide the destination
                    address in a button, so it's not immediately apparent where the link goes.</li>
            </ul>
